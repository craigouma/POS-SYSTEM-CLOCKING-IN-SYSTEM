# POS-SYSTEM-CLOCKING-IN-SYSTEM
This code creates two classes, POS and Clock, that respectively represent a point of sale system and an attendance/clocking system.

The POS class allows a user to add items to a cart and calculate the total price of the items in the cart. It also has a method to remove items from the cart.

The Clock class allows a user to clock in and clock out employees, and calculate the hours worked by an employee.

To use the code, you would first need to initialize the POS and Clock classes with the appropriate parameters. Then, you can use the methods provided by each class to perform the desired actions, such as adding items to the cart, clocking in employees, and calculating hours worked.

For example, you could add two apples and three bananas to the cart and then checkout to see the total price, or you could clock in three employees and then clock out one of them to see how many hours they worked.
